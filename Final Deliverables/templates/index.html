        Handwriting recognition is one of the compelling research works going on
        because every individual in this world has their own style of writing.
        It is the capability of the computer to identify and understand
        handwritten digits or characters automatically. Because of the progress
        in the field of science and technology, everything is being digitalized
        to reduce human effort. Hence, there comes a need for handwritten digit
        recognition in many real-time applications. MNIST data set is widely
        used for this recognition process and it has 70000 handwritten digits.
        We use Artificial neural networks to train these images and build a deep
        learning model. Web application is created where the user can upload an
        image of a handwritten digit. this image is analyzed by the model and
        the detected result is returned on to UI
